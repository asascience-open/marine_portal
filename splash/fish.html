    <td>Welcome! The Fishing site is currently under development. To date, the site provides access to existing MARACOOS real-time environmental data feeds. We are collecting input and additional data sets from commercial and recreational fishermen, and management partners. The objective of the site is to offer the public a relevant tool using real-time meteorological and oceanographic information from the MARACOOS network in an interactive desktop format and in a mobile application.</td>

    <td><img style='margin-left:10px' align='right' width=48 height=48 src='img/fishcatch48.png'>We are in the process of including publically available commercial fisheries bycatch information. To date we have included historical reports on sea herring/river herring and scallop/yellowtail bycatch locations. Our goal is to provide commercial and recreational fleets with the ability to view historical and real-time bycatch reports overlaid on various oceanic conditions. Captains can fish smarter and cleaner by seeking patterns over time that may help them avoid unwanted catches in the future.</td>
